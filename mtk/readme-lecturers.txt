Students: You don't need this file! Copy the rest of them :)

Lecturers:

These object files are the ones created from the games/ folder of the WRAMPmon repo, which should still be stored under ../legacy-teaching-material/Git/WRAMPmon/games.

If they're ever updated, please copy the new files into this folder and inform your students.

The Makefile is to be used by all students, and they should submit all of the files they used to compile their kernel. This makes both their and your lives considerably easier!
